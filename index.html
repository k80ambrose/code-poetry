  		<h1>twenty fourteen</h1> 
		<p>
			one time this guy asked me<br>
			what's the first year you remember?<br> 
			and i was like there's<br>
			a flourescent ball of blue light that predates memory<br>
			it radiates and permeates and hesitates<br>
			from center consule it operates<br>
			surveilling all i do<br>
			do you know her?<br>
			yeah he said<br>
			i do he said<br>
			i know the glowing green orb inside my skull he said<br>
			so then i was like<br>
			can i ask you a favor? and<br>
			he said sure<br>
			i need you to take my life<br>
			and dye it mint green<br>
			like Bethany Mota’s blood<br>
			overly saccharine and soft<br>
			cloying like cotton candy<br>
			hey guys! <br>
			welcome back to my channel<br>
			today we’re going to be doing something a l i t t l e diff e re n t<br>
			her voice fades into ukulele stock music<br>
			does it stick to your hands or get caught in the riptide?<br>
			lately i've been super duper lonely<br>
			but aparently everyone else is lonely too so<br>
			that makes it fine?<br>
			i heard if you<br>
			fly me to the brilliant Azure Sky<br>
			where two clouds hover<br>
			indefinitely<br>
			i never actually read <br>
			The Fault In Our Stars to completion<br>
			but its cover art alone<br>
			launched me into a terminal dream of An<br>
			sel Elgort<br>
			nsterdam and prepubescent<br>
			gnst<br>
			okay?<br>
			okay.<br>
			im so tired all the time<br>
			what ever happened to john green?<br>
			what ever happened to mint green?<br>
			it was never just a color<br>
			it smybolized some abstract<br>
			squeeky clean<br>
			Tiffany<br>
			Quaranteen<br>
			I've been a bad girl<br>
			why don't you wash my mouth out<br>
			with Bath and Body Works soap<br>
			Here, if you buy three <br>
			and I buy three <br>
			we can use the<br>
			BUY THREE <br>
			GET THREE <br>
			free <br>
			deal <br>
			I stare back at my friend blankly<br>
			she turns and enters the store<br>
			we're 13 in tysons corner<br>
			this is back when b&bw was still across from the Annie's kiosk on the lower level<br>
			before they relocated<br>
			their old store felt bigger 
			im not sure if it actually was bigger<br>
			I roam around for decades<br>
			pacing, unscrewing bottles, and sniffing their contents<br>
			I had to find the three products <br>
			and i wouldnt know which three were my favorite until i had sniffed<br>
			every bottle in the store<br>
			are you ready to check out?<br>
			I'd never be ready<br>
			I could spend eternity in that store<br>
			oh wow<br>
			oh no<br>
			oh fuck<br>
			its really bad isn't it?<br>
			yeah...<br>
			i'll try my best<br>
			i'll try my best<br>
			i'll try my very best<br>
			the listerine scene <br>
			squeeky clean
			quarantine
			Ebola <br>
			happened in 2014,<br>
			right?<br>
			do you remember when things went viral<br>
			before things were viral?<br>
			when everyone knew about whatever thing it was that week<br>
			the cycle churns even more rapidly but within little bubbles<br>
			numbers don't impress me<br>
			do you remember when every youtuber was still on vine?<br>
			are you on tumblr?<br>
			start designing your blog<br>
			and learn to code by accident!<br>
			YOU<br>
			yes, you!!! <br>
			You need <br>
			to learn to code! 1 !	1 !<br>
			go to code.org to participate in this year’s<br>
			hour 		of 		code<br>
			Haven’t you heard that Women in STEM are The Future?
			That’s the thing now<br>
			That's whats going to save us<br>
			girls online<br>
			don’t you remember Malalala’s speech?<br>
			don't you remember when things went flat?<br>
			you know its scary to think he said<br>
			that we're the youngest who remember a time before the Big Blue Ball enveloped everything<br>
			but we don't remember! i said that's my whole point!<br>
			yeah, but we know the ball exists and we know<br>
			at one point there was a reality outside of it<br>
			he said<br>
			the ones who came after us exist entirely within it<br>
			for us it was more of a voluntary descent<br>
			or i don't know about voluntary, but we had more agency in the matter<br>
			of setting boundries in our relationships with technology given that<br>
			we saw with our own eyes the proliferation of smartphones<br>
			and tablets and like the rise of social media that<br>
			happened in middle school we saw it happen when we were sentient beings<br>
			they didn't<br>
			they got here<br>
			and it already was this way<br>
			Does that make us responsible?<br>
			responsible for what? i asked<br>
			for telling them about the big blue ball insisde their bains?<br>
			whenever i think about bath and body works<br>
			i think about a bottle of cherry blossom lotion<br>
			that's sat a dresser in an attic in kingston new york<br>
			for over 30 years<br>
			yeah we're definetely responsible<br>
			asphyxiate me<br>
			with rainbow choker necklaces<br>
			when i gasp for air<br>
			put those pods in your ears<br>
			to mute my begging<br>
			hello?<br>
			helooooo???<br>
			when i die i'll think of 
			the cherry blossom lotion in kingston<br>
			and the way it smelled<br>
			it aged like a fine wine<br>
			trample me<br>
			with white converse<br>
			the big blue ball in our brains<br>
			it's just so<br>
			big beautiful and bright<br>
			inflated with infinite possibilities<br>
			i want to touch it<br>
			i want to squeeze it<br>
			i reach out<br>
			but it burns<br>
			tears well upon sight<br>
			its just so bright<br>
			and light<br>
			and #FFFervescent<br>
			so, to answer your original question<br>
			the first year I remember is mint green twenty fourteen<br>
			i remember a time and a place so far away,<br>
			even if you unraveled every infinity scarf<br>
			their yarn couldn’t span the cognitive distance<br>
			between now and then<br>
			i remember 
			i remember learning to love not to remember<br>
			when white converse turn red<br>
			the aquamarine queen is dead<br>
			her rain is over<br>
			slain bloodstain and sober<br>
			stop saying<br>
			i want to dye<br>
			it mint green <br>
			i want to be<br>
			so goddamn<br>
			ce rul ean<br>
			it burns if you stare too long<br>
			seafoam froths forth from <br>
			lips with delight<br>
			when the sky gapes open<br>
